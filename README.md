This repository contains tasks that I have completed during my **Machine Learning Internship** at MentorNess.
It was a 4-week Virtual Internship Program that I successfully completed.

It contains 3 tasks:

Task 1: **Article Writing**
Task 2: **Worldcup 2023 Analysis**
Task 3: **Salary Prediction**

Overall, as a Machine Learning Intern at MentorNess, I learned about **preparing data**, exploring it deeply, and making it visual. 
I explored different **algorithms for regression** to tackle the salary prediction problem and applied them.
This experience helped me a lot in polishing my skills.
